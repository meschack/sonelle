# Library Ingestion And Repair

## Owns

- desktop library ports and neutral library document models
- EPUB selection, import, metadata recovery, reference resolution, segmentation, and transactional
  persistence
- background repair of missing language and paragraph projections in legacy libraries
- catalog, bookmark, search, export, cover-asset, and reading-position adapters

## Refuses To Own

- reader presentation models, playback activation, Solid state, or narration preparation
- dictionary lookup and provider selection

## Interface

Renderer workflows depend on the small ports in `library-contracts.ts`. Native `library_import`
turns parsed EPUB data into a storage import. `library_migration` runs after startup on a blocking
runtime task, reads legacy rows in bounded keyset batches, and isolates individual repair failures.

## Domain Events

Import dispatches requested, cancelled, imported, and failed facts through the application
dispatcher. Native storage persists the resulting book, chapter, sentence, and paragraph
projections without maintaining a separate event history. Legacy repair logs failures to local
diagnostics and updates missing projections directly.

Readable manifest documents are available to spine extraction so relative footnote, endnote, and
citation targets can resolve across files. Reference markers are removed from narration text and
projected onto their owning sentence with an inline offset.

## Invariants

- library ports never import reader-owned DTOs
- imported text, paragraph, sentence, and reference projections commit atomically
- repair never blocks Tauri setup and one unreadable book does not stop later repairs
- batches remain bounded and resumable by stable identifiers

## Tests

Rust tests cover EPUB edge cases, transactional import, search, assets, and multi-batch repair with an
isolated failure. Renderer tests cover adapters and library workflows through their ports.
